# Master's thesis research playground
This project contains different test materials for research purposes for a master's thesis in computer science. The thesis title is "AI for Gin Rummy: Applying Counterfactual Regret Minimization in Imperfect Information Games". Here, a number of gin rummy agents can be found; RandomBotv2, GreedyBot, CFR-based agent and its variants, DeepLearningCFR and DLMCCFR. Here, you can run a game of gin rummy, choose player or bot agents, and simulate games. The project is written in Python.

# Installation
Use ```pip install -r requirements-txt``` to install dependencies. You might also need to install some additional packages.

# Running the project
Use ```python GinRummy.py``` to run gin rummy. From there, you should see a main menu where you can choose players or bot agents, and a tree depth limit (used only by CFR-based agents). Clicking start will take you to the gameplay screen.
